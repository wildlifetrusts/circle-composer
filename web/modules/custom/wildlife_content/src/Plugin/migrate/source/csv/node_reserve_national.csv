It is on the site of the former Woodside Colliery, one of the four that operated in this area until the 1960s. It contains a variety of habitats, including woodland, hay meadows and grasslands and a network of small wetlands. The grasslands are important for invertebrates, including several butterfly species such as common blue, gatekeeper, comma and meadow brown. Several species of ladybirds, grasshoppers and shieldbugs are also found here, as well as dragonflies and damselflies including the magnificent emperor dragonfly. Among the mammals that have been recorded on the site are brown hares and water voles. We are still discovering the wildlife of this extensive area of land and are starting to manage the habitats to encourage more birds, invertebrates and other wildlife. Parking at either Shipley Country Park Visitor Centre or Mapperley Reservoir gives access to a network of paths including the Nutbrook Trail, a 10-mile traffic-free path for use by walkers, cyclists and horse riders.</p><p>Off the Nutbrook Trail is our impressive new viewing tower, giving commanding views over the farm and surrounding countryside. Follow the Trail to Lodge Cottage and then look for the concession path near our new mole sculpture!</p><p>We are managing the extensive areas of grassland through a farming enterprise, which involves the sale of beef and lamb reared on the farm. Our aim is to produce good quality meat products on a farm which demonstrates good conservation practices. Find out more about Woodside Farm.</p><p>The farm now features a new education barn and garden, which is open to everyone. There are willow domes, ponds, a meadow for sweeping and a woodland as well as a covered picnic area.</p>",,,,"Reserve manager, Wildlife Trust","enquiries@derbyshirewt.co.uk","01773 881188",,,,"http://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk","Sadly we have had several dog attacks on our livestock at Woodside - please ensure you keep your dog on a lead when livestock is present to prevent this from happening.

Rich in historical remains.</p><p>Most of the island is 60 metres above sea level and is intersected by a series of ridges, the highest being near the centre at 75 metres high. At one point the island is nearly bisected, except for a narrow isthmus. Considerable evidence of human occupation in prehistoric times includes early field systems, huts and enclosures. The current farm buildings were erected in 1834 and the island managed as a farm, then passing through four different owners. The buildings were severely damaged by a storm in 1954 and renovation of the outbuildings started in 2005. The island was bought by the Nature Conservancy Council, now CCW, in 1959, with help from the Wildlife Trust.</p><p>During May and June the island is carpeted with Bluebells and Red Campion, with Thrift and Sea Campion seen along cliff edges later in the year. Large areas of the island are dominated by Bracken and much of the rest of the island is exposed and plants are therefore limited to salt and wind-tolerant maritime grasses.</p><p>The main interest of the island is the seabirds. The colony of Manx Shearwater is possibly the largest in the world, and the Puffin, Storm Petrel, Guillemot and Razorbill colonies present a significant proportion of the total population of these species in Britain as a whole. On the cliffs there are thousands of Kittiwakes, and hundreds of Fulmar, augmented by Herring, Lesser and Great Black-backed Gulls. Apart from the seabirds, breeding species include Short-eared Owl, Curlew, Chough and Peregrine. Other species include Oystercatchers, Mallard, Moorhen, Raven, Buzzard, Kestrel, Little Owl, Meadow Pipits, Skylark, Wheatear, Rock Pipit, Whitethroat and Dunnock.</p><p>The land mammals include a unique island race of Bank Vole, known as the Skomer Vole, as well as Wood Mouse, Rabbit, Common and Pygmy Shrew. The only reptiles on the island are Slow Worm and Common Lizard, and amphibians include Common Toads, Common Frogs and Palmate Newts. Butterflies include Meadow Brown, Grayling, Small Copper and migrants.</p><p>Grey Seals haul out onto the rocks at low tide and breed on the beaches and in the caves in autumn and early winter.</p>",1302,1201,"3526|3517|3530|3524|3510",,,,,,,https://www.welshwildlife.org,,""
