They can consist of rocks, sand, gravel, shingles, pebbles or cobblestones and are often a mixture of these; the consistency can be sandy, muddy and/or stony and, again, is often a mix of these.","<p>The highest point the tide reaches is the strandline. Here the tides leave behind sediments such as seaweed, dead plants and animal and, unfortunately, litter. Several strandlines can occur on a beach due to changes in the height of the tides.</p><p>Strandlines provide the main input of energy to sandy shores and intertidal habitats. They are particularly important on exposed shores, where they can act as precursors to sand dunes. As seaweed breaks down it produces organic matter which provides nutrients for pioneering plants trying to establish themselves in exposed beach and sand dune areas. Without this initial impetus, sand dune formation is severely limited.</p>","<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.</p>","<p>At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum.

1202,Coastal Grazing Marsh,,,"<p>The precise extent of UK coastal and floodplain grazing marsh is unknown. The best estimate is 300,000 hectares, of which two thirds are found in England. However, only a small proportion of this grassland (an estimated 10,000 hectares in the UK) is semi-natural habitat which supports a high diversity of native plant species, for example along the banks of the River Thames or in the Arun Valley in West Sussex.</p>",,108|109,"Grazing marsh is defined as pasture that is regularly flooded, or meadow with ditches that maintain water levels.","<p>Seasonally water-filled hollows and permanent ponds with emergent plants dot the landscape and standing water may be brackish or fresh. Almost all of these marshes are grazed and some are cut for hay. Strictly speaking, relatively few of the UKâ€™s coastal grazing marshes could ever be described as truly natural; most have been reclaimed from the sea by drainage and embankments.</p><p>These flooded fields are rich in wildlife with invertebrates swarming in the ditches, amphibians making their homes in the ponds, otters and water voles slinking in and out of the deeper waters, and wading birds making the most of the muddy margins for feeding on worms.</p>",,
