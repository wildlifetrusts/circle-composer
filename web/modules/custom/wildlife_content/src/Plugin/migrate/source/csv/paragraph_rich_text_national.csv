1502,"<p>The Wildlife Trusts are part of Greener UK – a group of 13 major environmental organisations with a combined public membership of 7.9 million – which is hosting the only hustings to be focused on the environment. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green Party spokespeople will be at the hustings and will have the chance to set out their ambitions on the natural environment, climate change, international environmental leadership and what leaving the EU will mean for the environment.</p><p>Please see details further below if you would like to attend or follow the hustings which will take place on Tuesday 30th May 2017 from 6.30pm – 8pm.</p><h2>The Wildlife Trusts and the general election</h2><p>The UK General Election is happening at a crucial time for our wildlife. The Wildlife Trusts believe that next Government will have some big decisions to make as soon as they are elected. The majority of our environmental laws are currently wrapped up with our membership of the European Union and so are key policies that have a big impact on wildlife - including agriculture and fisheries.</p><p>For the 2017 General Election The Wildlife Trusts would like to see all parties commit to:</p><ol><li>Nature's recovery in a generation. To achieve this will require us to transfer all current EU environmental laws into statute in the UK and ensure they are policed, and in England, to enact an Environment Act that restores the ecology of our rivers, farmland, soils and cities.</li><li>Protection of our marine wildlife through a well enforced and complete network of marine protected areas in UK seas and sustainable fisheries policies.</li><li>New sustainable policies for our farmland to allow wildlife to thrive alongside food production. Taxpayer’s money should be invested in creating abundant wildlife, healthy soils, clean water, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and beautiful landscapes for the benefit of everyone.</li></ul><p>Find out how you can take action and help give nature a better future in the run up to the 2017 General Election!

1504,"<p>In a previous blog, I made the case for a natural health service for mental health in the UK; the quote here is from Mind’s Head of Community Programmes and Grants, Gavin Atkins. It shows that the role of nature is starting to be taken seriously, and more importantly, gain credibility within the health sector. </p><p>Gavin’s blog, is one of a series being written for Mental Health Awareness Week, which also include a personal and through-provoking piece on Bird Therapy, by Joe Harkness.</p><p>If evidence were needed to demonstrate the power of nature every day, then you could do a lot worse than look at the reaction and comment created by a simple Facebook post that asked people to share why wildlife and wild places mattered to them – here are just 3 of many:</p><p>“I get anxiety quite bad, and I can honestly say nature is the best thing to help me”</p><p>“My son has autism, ADHD and anxiety and he is only 9 but being out in nature and looking for bugs or (looking) at the animals is the best therapy. <strong>It turns a stressed out and anxious boy into a calm and relaxed child. It's our therapy xx</strong>”</p><p>“I volunteer with The Wildlife Trust and other places to spend meaningful time outside, learning about, (and) helping to conserve, and enjoying our wild spaces. Taking care of our mental health is as important as any other aspect of our health and <strong>being outside in the fresh air, amongst nature, exploring and being active, provides really powerful healing for everyone</strong>”</p>"
1505,"<p>It’s the largest grower of birdseed in the UK – and at first glance a typical Lincolnshire fen farm, all flat land and big sky. But Vine House Farm is anything but typical. Owned by pioneering farmer Nicholas Watts, it is a living challenge to the idea that farming and wildlife can’t co-exist.</p><p>It was spotting a brambling in the garden that first sparked Nicholas’ love of birds. By the age of four he was already wandering along hedgerows, searching for nests. So it was natural that after he inherited the farm he should start conducting bird surveys.</p><p>His first species counts were in 1982. Ten years later he’d noticed a shocking trend: skylark numbers down by 60%, and corn buntings by 90%. “I could see wildlife was in trouble,” Nicholas says. But I was just lucky that I’m interested in birds and I could do something to help.” He began using the annual surveys to inform his farm management choices. His first step? To  replicate the pockets of habitat where wildlife was still thriving.</p>"
